# Ruh: Digital Mental Health & Psychological Support System

## Basic Info

**Problem Statement ID:** 25092

**Title:** Development of a Digital Mental Health and Psychological Support System for Students in Higher Education

**Description:**

**Context:**
Mental health issues among college students have significantly increased in recent years, including anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep disorders, academic stress, and social isolation. However, there is a major gap in the availability, accessibility, and stigma-free delivery of mental health support in most higher education institutions, especially in rural and semi-urban colleges.

**Problem Faced:**
- Absence of a structured, scalable, and stigma-free psychological intervention system.
- Lack of early detection and preventive mental health tools.
- Under-utilization of college counselling centres due to fear of judgment or lack of awareness.
- No centralized mental health monitoring or data-driven policy framework within institutions.

**Proposed Technological Challenge:**
Develop a Digital Psychological Intervention System (web-based and/or mobile app) with the following capabilities:
1.  **AI-guided First-Aid Support:** Interactive chat box that offers coping strategies and refers students to professionals when needed.
2.  **Confidential Booking System:** For appointment with on-campus counsellor or mental health helpline.
3.  **Psychoeducational Resource Hub:** Videos, relaxation audio, mental wellness guides in regional languages.
4.  **Peer Support Platform:** Moderated peer-to-peer support forum with trained student volunteers.
5.  **Admin Dashboard:** Anonymous data analytics for authorities to recognize trends and plan interventions.

**Department/Section Owning the Problem:**
Department of Student Welfare / Department of Psychology / Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC).

**Need for Digital Platform for Psychological Support:**
Most available apps are generic, Western-oriented, or paid. They do not integrate:
*   Regional cultural context and language
*   Institution-specific customization
*   Offline support mapping (e.g., linking with college counsellors)
*   Real-time analytics for admin

Hence, a tailored open-source solution is needed.

**Sample Data/Data Structures for Participants:**
*   Level of problem through standard psychological screening tools (PHQ-9 / GAD-7 / GHQ, etc.)
*   Mock student profiles (anonymized)
*   Institutional support structure (counsellor availability, resources, helpline)

**Org:** Government of Jammu and Kashmir
**Deptt.:** Higher Education Department
**Category:** Software
**Theme:** MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech
